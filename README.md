# WASDungeons Mod for Minecraft Dungeons

Since the release of Minecraft Dungeons a lot of players have been wondering if Mojang will ever add support for WASD controlls. Well you don't have to wait for Mojang now, because I am working to implement WASD Controls with this mod! The mod is only a overlay and is very similar to a macro and offers you no gameplay advantage.

# How does it work

I take the WASD keys and turn them into an analog signal. The WASD keys are basically turnt into a joystick. We then use these values to move the mouse around the screen to accurately mimic native WASD Controlls.

# Why doesn't it work for me/Why is it still buggy

This is still the first very early version. It is currently 2 am and the code for this is a mess right now, but I will fix and tidy everything up to get a stable version ready if enough people are interested.
